This is the newest rendition of my website. It now has a blog for some of my thoughts that I have put together to share with you, a feature I have been toying with for some time. In terms of blogs, I've floated from

- **the fun**: Tumblr
- to **the serious**: a dedicated LAMP stack hosted on a separate domain, nyetscape.com
- to **the plain ridiculous**: public HTML renditions of posts from my personal journal that are accessed and publicized through an API I built
  - hardly a need to say the risks of exposing my personal journal to the internet rendered this solution a pet project, let alone one seriously considered

## Problems with personal sites

I try to be pretty conscious about what I put out there on the web. Many changes in preferences have motivated the change of my personal website; for instance, when job searching I often used to add portions and links to work that was relevant to the jobs I was applying for. My current preference is to limit as much information as possible. My work experience has proven to me over again that information exposure risks permenant publiation, and almost never worth the risk. That's not to say I should limit how much I type on this new site; I simply would much rather share my thoughts with you all rather than personally identifiable information that, without narrative or explanation like this one, could be used to peice together a reflection of my career rather than my personality.

Somewhere down the line, a new problem was created. I had my personal website, which housed mostly personal information and links to my work, and my blog website. Each site was hosted by separate servers running in different parts of the world, under separate domains. One day, not long after I made a post on my blog, I was going through Google Analytics and noticed the immense referral traffic my blog was recieving from domains that *did not* originate from my personal website. While I expected at least a handful of people to visit my blog independent of visiting my website, I became more concerned with the attack surface I had created by spreading my online footprint across multiple servers. For one, it was wasteful, but two, it exposed more data than was necessary. I didn't want the responsibility of securing and defending my servers, and began to look for services with strong security departments that could host my data for me. As I grew more uncomfortable (and frugal) with operating remote servers I had no physical access to, I shut down everything.

And so I have operated under several constraints when it comes to designing new sites:

- industry standards for responsiveness
- want for a blog with an archive
- want for a portfolio page with limited list of my work
- no remote servers
- time management; updating my site has never really been a huge priority

## Enter Jekyll

With Jekyll and GitHub Pages, I am solving a lot of my problems. You can read about Jekyll on the [project site](http://jekyllrb.com), but basically it is a tool to generate static websites, websites without the need for a server. With GitHub Pages, I need no more than a free account to create a website and deploy Jekyll. I like Jekyll because it is open-source, and can be modified any which way I want. Additionally, its design ingesting templates and posts will come in handy when I really get blogging on this thing.

The point here is to minimize my information online to only a handful of sites. This site will act as a record, but also a mouthpiece depending on the issue. Any commentary or input I can provide *that has value* to an overall conversation will go on this site, provided its content isn't hurtful or intrusive. But it is important to recognize this site will probably neither have the volume of posts nor the traffic that [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/aaronsdevera) has. With this site I want to provide you with clear, thoughtful pieces on topics I find interesting and important, where the message requires more than the brevity and rapidity accomplished with Twitter. And I don't have the time to just blog all day. I'd rather post here as a need arises, and post to Twitter when a need calls. 

Lots of blogs put forward intentions and rules that they plan on respecting going into the future. I tried to do that here fully knowing that I may be scrapping or adpating next week. So I'll just play it by ear. Feel free to provide feedback or contact me anytime about anything, but note that I agressively filter. Don't expect a quick response, or one in plaintext for that matter.
