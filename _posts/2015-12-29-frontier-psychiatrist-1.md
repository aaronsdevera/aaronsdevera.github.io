title: Frontier Psychiatrist, a conversational video game
---

I am making a very primitive AI. Currently it's capable of basic speech recognition and natural langugage processing. It has a a pretty paltry decision/response tree, but it can sysntehsize speech back to you.

My plan is to incorporate this AI, as well as other I plan on building, as part of a game I am creating. I've named it **Frontier Psychiatrist**, and it will be available for OSX, Linux, and Windows in 2016.

Here is some background on how I started making this game. It goes back to a short scifi story I began writing in 2014, which follows a young woman named Hitome who lived in a cyberpunk-inspired city in the future. In a world where artifical intelligence is pervasive and machine learning programming has progressed to a very natural state, "psychiatrists" are dispatched to AI machines in derepair, using human psychiatry techniques to repair AI neural networks. The story follows Hitome, a psychiatrist, as she repairs AI using psychiatric approaches.

I never finished writing the short story. The more I wrote it, the more I envisioned it as a classic text-based video game, similar to the dungeon/adventure games played in the command line terminal. Hitome's communication with the machines left such an opportunity for interactivity that could be captured through gameplay. I programmed a well-logged and exhaustive text-based game of the first level, developing some of the story so that it could really immerse the player in the universe I was beginning to create.

But the more I tested the text-based game, the more I looked at the text and wondered "what if it was being said?" The step towards programming a visualization to match the one the fictional Hitome would see when working on an engagement with an broken AI was not a big step to take. As a graphical videogame, featuring NLP and speech recognition, there would be little for the player to imagine when entering the fictional universe, and could let the player focus more on the philosophical intent of this game: when does a machine cease to be one?

More updates to come.
