Twerp is an open source intelligence tool that allows you to see what other Twitter users see when they login in to Twitter. It does this by replicating their Twitter timeline. Who a Twitter user follows is publicly detailed on their profile page, but in an unorganized way that doesn’t display their tweets. Twerp obtains the account handles of your target user, then exports them to a private list on your account so that you can scroll through these users’ activity the same way your target user might.

How is this useful?! In a well-intentioned case: you may like a journalist and his work, and may want to see what type of accounts and tweets that journalist follows. In a more interesting case, an investigator may want to see the tweets and people that are influencing a targeted Twitter user. Whatever the case, Twerp is meant to help and enlighten… use it well!

Twerp is under development. It acquires account handles and exports to private lists great, but there are rate limits on the Twitter API that may be hampering its ability to compile large lists (say, if a user follows 3000+ accounts). Private users are just a total no-go, and they won’t appear in your exported private list.

You can access [the Twerp source code on Github](https://github.com/aaronsdevera/twerp).
