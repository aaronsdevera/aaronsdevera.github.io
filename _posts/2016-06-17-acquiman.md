Acquiman is an aggressive way to get new users for your product via Twitter. The program allows you to search for people on Twitter who are tweeting about a particular topic, and then engage with them about that topic with an automated message via direct message.

This use case program was developed for [Bring A Towel](http://bringatowel.com), a project run by my buddy [Sam](http://samajoseph.com). Bring A Towel is a travel suggestion website that utilizes shared knowledge about cities and their attractions. This program is a use case in aggressive acquisition for users to be encouraged to add their experiences to the site.
