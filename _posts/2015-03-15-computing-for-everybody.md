title: What's next? Computing for everybody
---

I love questions like this: "What's stopping us from..?" It's a great way to lay out all obstacles on the table. Sometimes there are many; other times, few. Often you may find that mentally handling the exceptions and obstacles to an idea can help you improve the ideas design and feasibility.

So I thought it through when my friend Rob asked me "what's stopping us from remotely connecting to desktop computers for everyday computing?"

Basically, nothing. Many enterprise employees use Remote Desktop connections, which allows a user to connect to one computer through another. It's a great method to pool resources and control access, and not very difficult to implement or scale. And, what's key, a Remote Desktop connection can allow a user with a weaker device--say, a smartphone--to a powerful, more capable device like a desktop machine or a server.

Let's run trough some benefits of Remote Desktop that could really affect a future consumer.

A standout application to me was the effect this could have in developing countries. companies like Google and Facebook are working hard to put the rest of the world online. Futurists like Nicholas Negroponte and his One Latop Per Child program have spent millions developing low-cost computers for the developing world. The One Latop Per Child program made incredible strides towards developing durable, kid-friendly machines, but their cost was still too much to cause mass disruption; in some cases, students only [used the computers 14% in 2012 and the effect on test scores was negligble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Laptop_per_Child#Regional_responses). Cheap laptops in the past were designed to simply provide information. If we want to make STEM education a priority at younger ages in more classrooms around the world, we need platforms that promote computing power and sandboxed environments for experiments in addition to the information provided by the internet.

But with a Remote Desktop platform, we could divest efforts to make capable mobile computers or phones. Instead, we can make computers capable only of networking and displaying a Remote Desktop connection. Developer boards like the Raspberry Pi are powerful enough to do many things, such as connect to the Internet and display HD video. In a focused effort, it would not be improbable to say that we could develop a client-facing logic board  for a retail price less than $35, the retail price of the Pi.

Client-facing machines would connect to regional servers capable of handling their clients’ needs. The powerful process handling of the advanced servers would beam the visual of a computing experience back to the clients, as if the field user had the power of a supercomputer in the palm of their hands. Process-heavy computing applications like data analytics, medical research, secure banking, software engineering,and video editing could all be done in the resource deficient deserts of Mali, the foothills of the Andes, or the rice fields of Vietnam.

Of course, this would all require strong internet availability in these remote regions. Bit that’s an imminent reality coming to fruition. Once these regions come online, people will no longer be asking "how can I connect," but rather "what can I build?"
