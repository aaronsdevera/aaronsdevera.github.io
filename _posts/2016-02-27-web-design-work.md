Here is a small selection of projects I've worked on where I put a lot of work on the web design.

Best is a project I am working on with [@kennydurk_in](https://twitter.com/kennydurk_in) for Yelp's API hackathon. It will tell you the best restaurant, according to similar data mining techniques used by [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-search-of-americas-best-burrito/).

## Frontier Psychiatrist

Frontier Psychiatrist is a (video game I am working on)[http://aaronsdevera.com/2015/12/29/frontier-psychiatrist-1/]. The Electron framework allows me to develop the front end of the game in HTML5/CSS3/JQuery just like any other website, but have it run natively as an application on OSX, Windows, and Linux.

## Personal Site

I designed this site! It runs on Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

## Stockswipe

Stockswipe is a hackathon submission I created with and [@kennydurk_in](https://twitter.com/kennydurk_in) and [@otwizb](https://twitter.com/otwizb) at Stony Brook's Unhackathon 2015. Using the Leap Motion as a gesture input we created a hands-free stock lookup tool.
