title: WiFi Punching Bag: Embedded Athletic Systems for Live Data Monitoring
---

This is a test of a cloud-based platform to measure motion in athletic equipment. The first deployment of the sensor will be on a 100lb. punching bag, with a web companion program that will be tracking punch efficiency and power. The same system can be easily applied to wearable equipment like helmets/pads and allow for streaming diagnostic impact data (eg. how hard a player sustains a tackle).

Based on the Spark Core WiFi development board, with a backend service developed with Python, with web deployment built with Flask and Socket.io.
