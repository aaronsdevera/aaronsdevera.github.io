title: Cyborg - Make a Twitter bot with any username
---

Cyborg is a project between [@kennydurk_in](https://twitter.com/kennydurk_in) and [@mgkael](https://twitter.com/MGkael) and myself for the Spring 2016 HackNY hackathon at NYU.

Cyborg makes Twitter bots that copy the writing style of any username you provide it with. It studies a large sample size of a user's tweets, then uses Markov chains to generate new tweets in the same style.

I contributed to the project's back-end functions, which included the generation of new tweets using a Markov algo in Python.

Check out the project [here](https://github.com/kennydurkin/Project-Cyborg), it runs!.
